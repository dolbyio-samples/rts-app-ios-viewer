## Cloning the repo

The Dolby.io Realtime Streaming Monitor sample app is hosted in an Xcode workspace. There are two Swift Package libraries under the `LocalPackages` directory.

Get the code by cloning this repo using git.

> **_Info:_** The main branch is constantly under development. Get a tagged branch for a stable release.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dolbyio-samples/rts-app-ios-viewer.git
```

## Building and running the app

Go to the project directory, and open the Xcode workspace - `RTSViewer.xcworkspace` by either double-clicking on it or from the Xcode directly.

From the top of the Xcode, Select either the scheme `RTSViewer iOS` or `RTSViewer TVOS`.

From the top of the Xcode, select the actual target to be run on.

> **_Info:_** To run on a real device you need to have an **Apple Developer Account**. For more information, see Apple documentation.

If a real device is selected, you shall connect or pair the device with your Xcode first. This is not necessary if a simulator is selected. The Xcode shall start the simulator and connect with the selected simulator automatically in the next step.

Click on the `Start` â–º button on top of the Xcode to start running and debugging the app.
